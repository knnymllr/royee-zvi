What I wanted I could<br>
not have<br>
at least for a time<br>
what to do with information like that?<br>
what else to do<br>
except<br> 
to see the Brandywine<br>
before the flight<br>
and watch the water wheels turn<br>
and thank the guides<br>
and pay for the souvenir<br>
they were filming a commercial<br>
there in the grass<br> 
below the stripped-to-white sycamores<br> 
it begged the future<br> 
girls were sitting to a staged picnic<br>
they had prop grapes and cheese<br> 
you and I walked by<br> 
knowing the deceit<br> 
and when your hand skimmed my cheek<br>
it went immediately to memory,<br> 
growing its own life there<br>

we drove around the county then<br>
idle driving<br> 
going by feeling<br> 
the chicory leapt up<br>
as we sped<br>
the hemlock too<br>
the maps were useless,<br>
didn’t serve our purposes<br> 
didn’t get to the heart of the matter quick enough<br> 
and what was it?<br>
time, like always, and never enough of it<br>
you tried convincing me<br>
to unmoor a boat<br> 
to unmoor it for us<br>
and likely, in the end, it was the heart itself<br>
floating far off the coast of my jurisdiction

to the island of you<br> 
spelling messages in the sand<br>
though not the usual ones<br>
I wasn’t in need of rescue<br>
