I tried to tell them,<br>
there is more<br>

I tell the rabbi,<br>
my father,<br>
the funeral home,<br>
Dignity Memorial USA,<br>
anyone who will listen<br> 
that she was my mother but she was more than that<br>
“beloved wife and mother”<br>
this is what they want to put<br>
I suggested, “how about beloved<br>
individual,<br>
confidant,<br>
devourer of paperbacks,<br>
soap-opera marathonist of the Greater Northeast?”

my father<br>
he’s on the phone<br>
he’s suggesting, “how about adding ‘sister’?”<br>
I say, “fine”<br>
what’s done is done<br>
anyway<br>
what’s lived is lived<br>
beyond granite<br>
would need more<br> 
granite<br> 
to get it all down
