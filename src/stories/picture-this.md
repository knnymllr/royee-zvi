Three men all hugging and crying in the living room; my father, my brother, and me. The last time I saw it was when the Phillies won the World Series. But this was not that. Mother died, father said, and apologized as if he thought we thought it was his fault, like it wasn’t cancer but some negligence of his, like he forgot to replace batteries in a smoke alarm. As if we didn’t already know why we were woken up in the middle of the night! Why I was woken up, I mean. I had just been there a few hours before, turning on the fan for my mother by her bed and then asking if she needed anything else, and after my mother gasped the word “water” I got her a glass half full. And later, having to go get my brother out of work and drive for an hour from our small town to their small town, thinking there is still a chance that she was alive. 

“Is she dead, you think?” my brother says, plugging in his earphones. 

“Let’s not jump to conclusions,” I say. I speak one thing and think the other. I turn the radio on and a star catches fire. The static and beeps come through––the muffled voices of newsmen, crackling as if through cotton. 

I pull into the driveway where the nurse from the hospital, the nurse that is overworked, sits in the car that the hospital provided her. She is probably wondering whether the date of death should officially be the 4th or the 5th because my mother probably died when it was still the 4th, but they only discovered her dead on the 5th. 

“She looks peaceful,” my father says. “She looks peaceful,” my mother’s sister, Anna agrees. “She’s up there, in the bed.” But I don’t go up. My brother does, I can’t. And why I can’t is because my last memory was a good one: giving her the water and turning on the fan and saying, “I’ll see you next week.” 

I can hear my brother howling. There is nothing peaceful about this. And I cannot even go upstairs to sleep. I don’t go up until well after I hear two men taking the body away. Maybe it is months after. The nurse comes and marks down the time. She looks at me curled up on the couch. Everything is marked for the official record, entries and exits, punching in and punching out.       

Picture me the morning after, speechless as my aunts and uncles from all over the Tri-State area come into the house and wake me where I’m sleeping on the couch, and all I can muster is the strength to reach my arms out to them knowing that the distance between them and their mothers is only a long-distance call. 

And then there is the rabbi who is far too young. The rabbi who is not the rabbi we are used to but the one sent in his stead. The rabbi that is probably my age but because of his long beard and anemic face and the puffs of breath he makes as he looks at us, it is hard to see him as a youthful person.

He says to me, “You are the eldest son of the departed?”

He says to my brother, “You are the youngest son of the departed?”

To my aunt, whom he identifies as sister, and to my father whom he calls husband, he repeats the same formula. As if these statistics will enable him to make a proper eulogy. 

“Tell me some information about this person, so I can say a few words.”

“She was like my best friend,” said not by my father but by my brother.

“She was fun to be around,” said not by my aunt but by my father.

“We would go up to the roof when it wasn’t too hot, our game to each bring a book and see who could finish it fastest,” said not by me but by my aunt. “Whole days up there,” she said, crying.

And me. How could I follow that up? So when the young rabbi, twisting his beard, looks any minute like he would just faint from the chair we’d brought into the living room for him, I just don’t say anything. 

Picture early September in Pennsylvania before the leaves turn. Picture a green tent, under which sit green chairs, on top of which sit the mourners, above which the silver maple trees toss and turn and shrug. We get front row seats of course. My father and my brother and my aunt and me. And the casket sits there. The casket that I am to pretend my mother now inhabits. And it is a hot day. And there is the supposedly young rabbi trading words with the mourners before we get started. I don’t feel one way or the other about him. I could take him or leave him. He doesn’t know my mother at all and he is about to give some really bland remarks. He has notes written down. It’s not the whole of my mother’s life, it’s as if he’s crammed for a test. In his hand is the razor he will use to cut our shirts. 

People come that I’ve never met, maybe heard their name in passing once, but people all the same who claim they knew my mother. Which surprises me because my mother never left the house except to work. There are some people from her workplace there. In particular there is this very tall, very handsome pharmacist whose face, when he shakes my father’s hand, crumples like an accordion and he starts weeping. I mean, real water works. Like watching streams tumble down a mountain.

The prayers are said. Prayers? Blessings? Death rites. I have not shaved and now I will not shave thirty days more. Our shirts are cut. Our eyes fix on the lowering casket. Our ears on the squeak of the pulley. Our father cries for the second time. 

The rabbi goes ahead with his little speech cobbled-together from what we’ve provided him. He’s got another thing coming if he thinks this will be the last words spoken during my mother’s final moments above ground. He invites us to share something. My father takes this opportunity to thank everyone for coming. My brother says the thing about him losing a best friend. I take a deep breath and reach into my pocket for the words I wrote in the dead of night. Me not being a man of spontaneous remarks but of words in the dead of night. The words one can only write when everyone else is asleep, with no one looking over your shoulder. 

“I prepared a few words.” Prepared as in edited and re-edited a dozen times while the pink daylight began penetrating the blinds. As in marked with pen in secret. As in till the last minute in the back of the car bumping along through the cemetery pathways. It’s only right. She deserves more than what the rabbi said. Much more. She deserves to still be alive. Deserves? I tell myself not to get too ahead of myself with using that word. This could possibly be the most deplorable word in all the English language. Anyway, wouldn’t you like to know how to send a mother off? 

<br>

“Over the past few weeks, and particularly on this afternoon, there is a word that has been turning over in my mind, and that has catalyzed in me a bittersweet reflection amid the tempest of this grief. This word is ‘inheritance’. Not the kind measured in dollars and cents, or in items left behind, but the kind measured in attributes, in dispositions, in physical manifestations, in eccentricities and quirks and curiosities passed down, born out of a genetic heirloom that weaves its double-helixes with the data and the promise of what one becomes. Inheritance. That original birthright. Who you are before you know who you are. Before you can even conceive of yourself; it seems the markers are largely there, at birth. And what do we inherit from those who gave us life and raised us? My father will be the first to corroborate that I am indeed my mother’s son, through and through. From my mother I inherited a voracious love of books, an aversion to smiling in pictures, the solemn side of my sense of humor, a fear of change. At times, a pessimistic outlook, a stubborn streak, a strong heart, anxiety, an argumentative spirit, and nameless other nuances crystallized in idiosyncrasy. 

I can say without reservation that the most significant thing my mother contributed to me besides life was a love of literature. To live all those lives through the page. My prevailing belief is that books are windows, and through them you are made to see; you are made a more empathetic person. On a smaller scale, and in less elegiac tones, I’m sure my mother shared this belief. And––no surprise to me or perhaps to anybody in the family––for the past ten years I have spent much of my free time writing fiction. And it must be said—to an audience that may not understand the compulsion to sit alone in a room all day composing make-believe—that to concoct a narrative work of your own freewheeling imagination is a difficult, tedious undertaking. But at least you are in control. You play God. You dictate what happens. But what no one prepares you for is how far beyond your imaginative grasp real life can be. How the complete authority over one’s fictional representation of the human condition crumbles so cruelly in the face of a story about which you cannot control any aspect or write the plot another way. I write to make sense of things. And this makes what I have said here today the hardest thing I’ve ever had to write—the nonsensical abbreviation of a life. Even though the circumstances are spelled out, and the facts are the facts, you simply cannot tolerate this inability to control the narrative. And there is nothing to edit the mind that tells you: no more. No more soap operas, no more books, no more cards, no more jokes, no more wisdom to impart, no further questions, no more fingers through the hair that only a mother knows how to do in the right way, no more.

Make no mistake about it—we are on divine loan. We are given a life and we owe it back. And the interest we pay for our being here is our time. I would like to conclude, if ever you were yearning for a tall order, by talking about what I think to be the meaning of life. And in doing so, I call upon the writer Franz Kafka who, in his determination of life’s meaning, finds a way to be concise and yet, by virtue of his very conciseness, finds a way to amplify the meaning of what it is to be alive and to appreciate life. Kafka writes: “the meaning of life is that it ends”. The meaning of life is that it ends. That it ends is the meaning. That in the finite nature of life is where one can extract all the meaning and beauty one could ever hope for. And one should. Start now. Start here. The sheer awe at awaking each morning to the bewildering, transcendent, inconceivable apparatus that is a life. Something I’m not likely to take for granted again so long as I live.”

Then I sit down. Then somebody I do not know, a friend of my father’s whom I’ve never seen, taps me on the back and whispers, “Kafka. Nice!”

My father leans over and says, “I couldn’t have said it better myself, but it was a little long.”

Then we each stand up again and accept the spade from the rabbi to pitch a bit of dirt on top of my mother. I came into the world clinging to her breast, only to throw dirt on her in the end. The spade changes hands, friends and family taking turns. I think it’s supposed to go on like that until the whole grave is full, but I think I also did not understand how deep six feet really is. So that eventually, once everyone goes back to their cars, once I am waiting there to go, standing by a tree looking at all the other Jewish headstones, at all the other Jewish surnames, I can see them bringing around the backhoe to fill what we could not fill. 

People come up to me to say goodbye, to promise to be in touch, to promise to visit, to promise. 

Picture the reception afterwards at my uncle’s mansion across the river in New Jersey. Picture the spread. Bagels: half a dozen poppy seed, half a dozen sesame, half a dozen plain, a few egg, a single pumpernickel. Whitefish and tuna. Cucumbers and olives. Smoked salmon and cream cheese and a bowl of chopped scallions. Biscuits and poppy seed cake and coffee and tea. 

My uncle says to my father, “Think that’s enough? Should we run out for more?” My father looks at him as if he’s about ready to wring his neck. I am sitting with a half-eaten poppy seed bagel listening to my uncle’s wife’s mother, who lost her husband a couple years before, talking about Trump like a liberal Jewish woman from the Midwest might talk about Trump. This takes my mind off the rabbi who bar-mitzvahed me, who showed up late, telling my father that because it is a Friday before a holiday, our shiva will be cut short. A two-day shiva. Good enough for me, I think. I think I couldn’t possibly sit inside all day for a week without also wanting to die. 

A red-headed woman, a friend of my uncle, whom I’ve seen at seders over the years, comes up to me and says, “I didn’t know you were a writer, how cool!” And proceeds to tell me about a workshop she goes to in Philadelphia and wouldn’t I like to bring some material to the workshop? It’s only $200 and, she says, for that kind of money you really get a great value. I tell her I’m not into groups. I almost say that the money would go further in an Amsterdam whorehouse. I feign interest when she talks about the kinds of stories she writes: cute, boring, suburban tattletales of the kind I cannot stand.

A strong, dark-skinned Israeli who used to work with my father on Jeweler’s Row in the 90’s comes up to me and says, “I want you to meet my daughter. I want to set you up with my daughter. A poet. A genius. That’s what you are, and that is who deserves my daughter. Here’s a picture,” he says, putting the cell phone in my face. And I cannot tell him right at this moment how much I would like to fuck his daughter, because I am feeling more depressed about life than I’ve ever felt, feeling smaller than I’ve ever felt, and so I say, “She looks nice.” This makes him smile from ear to ear.

Then the old lady again, who asks me, “Dear, can you fix a bagel for me? A plain one. Lox and cream cheese, but not a sarcastic amount, and a bit of onion.” Then I’m smiling, and for the first time all day, because it gives me something to do. Something achievable. 

Then the rabbi gathers us all in the living room and I am hanging onto every word because now here’s a rabbi that knows our family, here he will say something wise in the manner of rabbis who are old enough to have seen something. Here finally, at long last, after the long, hot day. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. 

He asks for my mother’s Hebrew name. My father says she didn’t have one. My rabbi approximates “Keren” from “Catherine” and gives us this line about the meaning of the name and how it is inextricably tied to how she lived and how she died. It is the same way that the horoscope-obsessed talk about the zodiac in a way that is supposed to explain the whole human being. So stop. I almost say it out loud. But that would not be appropriate to tell the man who bar-mitzvahed me. It might be appropriate to say to my uncle, who for the third time is asking my father if there is enough food. This time, my father seethes, “Let them starve for all I care,” and cries for the third time I’ve ever seen him cry. Because he is probably remembering how hard it was for my mother to eat anything but soup. And then anything at all. How the doctor told my father that whatever she eats belongs to the cancer now. 

My brother, for whom loss is a latent feeling, is out in the driveway playing basketball with my cousins. It will hit him harder in the coming weeks. For me it is immediate and then, ha ha, fat chance if you’ll ever hear me talk about it again. Except of course when I ask you to picture what I am picturing when I really sit and remember that day. 

Picture later the same day. Picture us looking at photo albums on the couch. These huge, distressed ring binders full of photographs that are supposed to give us an idea of what life was like. 

We’re flipping through them. The four of us from the beginning. And it’s mostly laughs and smiles. Everyone is focused on only remembering these snapshots and how she looked in them but even with the evidence before me, far beyond a reasonable doubt, I cannot remember what she looked like prior to what she looked like in the days and weeks leading up to the end.

As her weight began drastically declining, the sight of her shuffling into the kitchen––dragging behind her the long translucent tube belonging to the oxygen machine, her shirt hanging loosely over her atrophied arms––not only stirred in me the normal feelings of a son for his mother, but made me pity her. And when she looked me in the eyes, I could sense that she was ashamed at how the roles had been reversed. Mother and son ruined forever. She was the child now. The pain and exhaustion of walking upstairs was to her not only a physical cruelty but an emotional one, too. I led her up each night by the arm. She stayed downstairs until bedtime when she would make the arduous walk up the stairs.

I came home one day to my father cutting a plank of wood in the garage. He was always busy with his hands. I didn’t inherit his skill for craftsmanship. But that’s why he said I had better get good grades in college, so I could make enough money to pay someone else to do the work I couldn’t do.

“Another of your projects?” 

He didn’t look at me but said, “Something like that.” 

So I helped him hold the plank in place while he checked measurements written in pencil on a piece of paper. I didn’t ask him what it was for. We sawed and sandpapered it and walked it inside and there he made my mother sit up. My mother who is bald and bloodless, my mother who is coughing and gasping, and lifted the couch cushions so he could place the plank of wood underneath it that would provide some support for my mother, who now spent all day on the couch, which was a much-too-soft couch for someone needing to die on it.

This is what I am thinking about as I look at the photo albums. There are the coming-to-America pictures, the backyard wedding, the births and milestones, report cards and school portraits, trips to Israel, pictures with grandparents, birthday parties, Superbowls at my uncle’s, blizzards back when blizzards still came to Philadelphia. It all feels so far away. Like I am looking at the lives of strangers. I may as well be flipping through a catalog; that’s how remote it feels from the life I know. And maybe that’s the point. 

It starts to get dark. The sun is setting on the day which is the first day of our new life without a mother or wife or sister. It is about the time that she would be walking through the door after work, exhausted, prepared to do nothing but walk up to the bedroom, turn out the lights, and watch her soap operas. She was probably a little depressed. When I think of myself and I think of my mother it is very likely that the largest inheritance from her is depression. 

Now picture what no one could have pictured. We’re about done with the photo albums when it happens. We went through the motions of the day. We did our familial duty. In a lot of ways, our day was no different from any other day for a family mourning a loss. Except when we hear my mother’s cell phone going off in the upstairs bedroom. Nobody moves. Nobody says a word. We let it ring. To me it is like a siren going off. It’s the first time I realize she’s gone, as in, forever. That it is permanent. That there is no one to pick up that phone. Somebody trying to get hold of her, not realizing she is dead. I could hear the clocks ticking. I could see the trees far out there in the darkness. We sat, all of us, not knowing what would happen next.
