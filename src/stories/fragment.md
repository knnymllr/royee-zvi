  If the earth’s flat 
  why does the river move? 
  my heart splits like wood
   breaks like thunder
   runs clean like rain
weight: "0"

If the earth’s flat 
why does the river move? 
my heart splits like wood
 breaks like thunder
 runs clean like rain 
I am in every place  
my mortal borders  
are the graced field 
the sycamore
 the silence
 the fog
 my Brandywine runneth over 
I’m a man who’s loved and been loved in return 
more than that
 I cannot ask
 can anyone?
 sing in me, Muse 
of the delights to come 
if the afterlife is full of Saturdays like this 
I’d believe in it
