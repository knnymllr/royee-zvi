The Christians down the road wanted me for their own. It was not long after I’d moved to the suburbs and befriended Connor Posey that I began to spend most of my days after homework at his house. He was chubby, freckled, and knew how to moonwalk. I was in love with his older sister Jess. And his parents must have said something to him one day, because when we got off the bus at the neighborhood park, he told me that I was going to hell because I was a Jew.

He looked upset about it, as though it were a fact forced upon him, one he didn’t want to know. Said it without pleasure. “Please don’t take it personally,” he said, looking down at the ground, foot circling the asphalt. “I still want to be friends.” Then he said I could still come over that day to play video games, but that his parents might want to talk to me about the Lord over our grilled cheese sandwiches.

Bill and Sue Posey were former Irish-Catholics from South Philly who were now Born-Agains remade in Bucks County, which granted them––in their self-assessment––a kind of superiority even over their extended family who stayed Catholic, never mind a Jew like me. They often, in the midst of trying to convert me, spoke of the phenomenon of finally accepting Jesus into their hearts. “He really died––*for all of us*.” You could tell these were true believers. Their eyes shone with mission-making certainty. And I trusted they knew more about Jews than I did, since I did little to explore them myself beyond my mother and father.

“We just want to be sure,” Sue said as we ate our grilled cheeses, “that when the rapture comes, you won’t be left behind.” She was an obese woman with fair freckled skin, long black hair, blue eyes. She dominated that household. And what she said then terrified me. The word *rapture*. I thought of dinosaurs. She filled my ears with apocalypse: that it was coming soon, any day now, and that I’d better think hard about whether I wanted to remain a Jew and suffer for eternity.

At first, I was stunned. Then I was confused. It wasn’t the first time I’d encountered antisemitism since moving there, but usually it was more direct. The first time the accusation of “Christ-killer” was leveled at me at my new school––from a skinny redhead whose spittle congregated at the corners of his mouth––it was said with such brutish certainty that I wasn’t prepared to defend myself. Instead, I went to the library after school to read up on how culpable (or not) we were in the matter of deicide.

With the Poseys, it seemed to come from a place of concern. That attracted me––already full of doubts and anxieties, hedging pride, and outright rejections of myself. Like being called a Christ-killer, I approached the Posey’s invitation to Bible study as a chance for serious inquiry into other religions, perspectives, ways of life. At least that was the lie I told myself then. A strong alibi for the shame. I had grown up reading Greek mythology. My childhood friend was Egyptian. My nanny was a beautiful Druze who resembled Madonna down to the beauty mark. My block in the neighborhood I’d lived in before moving was mostly Russians. I was hyper-observant to everyone’s quirks and habits, how their houses were decorated, what rules they followed, what was in their fridges that weren’t in ours.

To that end, I liked going to the Posey’s a lot. They ate all the things my parents wouldn’t let me eat. They ate horribly, cheaply, indulgently. These were not healthy people. 32-ounce Big Gulps from 7-Eleven were a custom never once reconsidered. Anytime the drive-thru attendant at McDonalds asked if they’d like their fries super-sized or to add a piece of apple pie, there was no hesitation. I would look on from the backseat of their white Ford Taurus, mesmerized as Sue handed over enormous bags to Connor and Jess. At home, she’d mix sugary artificial lemonade. On special occasions, Kool-Aid. During Bible study, we’d eat sodium-saturated frozen meals or big pots of mac and cheese. Save for lettuce, I never saw a vegetable in the fridge.

They binged on reality TV all day and smoked cigarettes inside. The linoleum in the kitchen was sticky, and a wet sock smell canvassed the home, poorly masked by discount candles from Walmart. No one watched us, nor cared what we were up to. Cursing was fine, so long as no one dared take the Lord’s name in vain. It was strange to watch the contradictions pile up. And yet, once I got over how differently they lived from me, the invitation to Wednesday Bible study was flattering. These were people, holy people, that I could learn from. However they outwardly presented, I felt them to have access to a pure and secret knowledge and, hidden in it, my salvation.

Each claimed to have personal relationships with Jesus and could vouch for me. I wondered how Jesus had time for all of them. I was even jealous of Jesus, because that meant he had a relationship with Jess. Jess liked him *a lot*. He was probably allowed in her room, allowed to watch her sit on the floor painting her nails or brushing her hair before bedtime in her silk camisole. I was forbidden to enter. “You’re not allowed in––that’s private!” she said, swinging the door shut. I could smell her perfume as she passed me. I could see a flash of pink wall and glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling. I fantasized about kissing her, feeling my way across her Waspy dimensions in the dark like a blind man trying to decipher what made her her and me me.

A few Wednesdays later, we sat at the table with our open Bibles. Sue licked a chubby forefinger, fitted with a long fake nail, before turning the smooth, delicate pages of Revelation––the most doomsday marketing material available to get me to consider salvation on my own terms, as though I were an adult capable of making life-altering choices. To their credit, they sensed that I already felt that way about myself––a man hampered by boyish limitation. But this, too: they knew what I knew––that I didn’t know myself. When Connor first started inviting me over, he’d complain that I’d rather sit and talk to his parents than play Nintendo. I wanted life to accelerate. Sometimes, I look back on all this and wager how complicit I was. For one, I was a child. But I was a child so ashamed about his otherness, ready to escape by any means necessary, that it was hard to tell where their responsibility ended and mine began.

Northeast Philadelphia was protective in ways the suburbs were not when it came to how I saw myself. I went to the JCC during summers where after free swim I’d roam the locker room hearing old men cracking jokes––most with their balls out and hair in their ears and some with faded numbers on their forearms. I attended Anne Frank Elementary School. On high holidays, we’d drive to Beth Sholom in Elkins Park with its translucent walls and wooly gold light––the only temple designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.

Sue was reading:

*“But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars––they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur.”*

Before I could figure out which category of the condemned I––and, by extension, the Jews––fell under, we were instructed to backtrack to an earlier verse.

*“I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.”*

It went on like that, cherry-picked verses designed for maximum shame. She closed the book and stared at me.

“Do you see now why you need to accept Christ into your heart? You can’t be a Jew and go to Heaven unless you accept that he died for *your* sins, too.”

I looked around the table, first at Connor, then at Jess. All I saw were uncomfortable stares in return. I went to the bathroom, turned the faucet on full blast, and cried. When I came back, I asked Sue, “So how do I do it? How do I convert?”

How did I know it was wrong? I didn’t tell my parents. That was my first clue that something here was not right. But I figured they had enough to deal with. Both worked long hours at a deli with my uncle. My mother rang up ryes at the register and my father sliced meat with his brother.

Ours was not unlike many immigrant stories. I straddled two worlds. My parents were secular Israelis. We observed the major holidays but nothing more, and even those we did with little effort. Both had packaged their Judaism into such small parcels that I imagined they kept them down in the basement with the Hannukah decorations. I had aspirations to make mine smaller still. I wanted to be American, not Jewish. Back then, I thought history was a sheddable thing.

I knew I had about thirty minutes until my mother came home. I went up to my room with the piece of paper Sue gave me, and began to recite what she’d written for me to say:

*“Dear God, I realize I am a sinner and could never reach heaven by my own good deeds. Right now, I place my faith in Jesus Christ as God's Son who died for my sins and rose…”*

A memory filled me then, of when I was eight and visited the Western Wall for the first time with my father. When I approached the wall, and pressed my hand against the cool, porous stone, I became aware of an energy surrounding me. I maintain to this day that although I’m not a religious person, I was in the grip of an unexplainable force. That same feeling came to me then, and stopped me. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t say the words. My conversion was foiled. Just then, I heard keys jingling, the door opening, and my mother, home early, calling for me.

I ran downstairs crying, wrapping my arms around her and burying my face in her work apron. It still smelled of caraway seeds.

“What happened? What happened? Is everything okay?”

She lifted my face, her fingers clearing tears. I could hear the clocks ticking. They were suddenly so loud. I couldn’t tell her. I fed her some lie. Then I went to play outside.
