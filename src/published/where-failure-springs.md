*for Luli*

You do not know how I feel\
if this is the world to come\
if the afterlife is full of Saturdays like this \
I'd believe in it

yesterday, you davened\
behind an archway\
of pockmarked stone\
smoothed with devotion\
I sat there watching ants make trails in thousand-year moss\
grown, like all of us, in the fault-lines\
where failure springs

you braved the mass to reach\
the charming hawkers\
sitting belly-stout with cigarettes,\
throne-bound,\
blowing smoke over produce and shouting\
love into the Sabbath

a pigeon picks its way westward\
you point and say: “That bird is a Jewish bird”\
gone are traces of irony

yours is the wonder\
yours is the innocence\
looted from everyone long ago

held in a tiny body thrumming\
with joy enough\
to hold everyone’s joy

we move a mattress to a man living in filth\
we give our money away in the street for blessings that can’t be bought\
we make lunch for your friends\
they are Americans\
their baby is soft and alert and doesn’t cry\
\
at night the air whistles\
over sunburned skin\
you asked could I feel the\
change in the air––\
what made it holy?

and I am thinking, \
this feels to me a question with two answers\
this feels to me a poem, not a story\
instead, I say, “You do not know how I feel”\
but you are sleeping already\
five foot\
dreams are taking you\
\
and I am remembering: earlier\
you standing by with the groceries\
as the Chabadnik wrapped me\
saying with gray eyes, “You know,\
when Jacob saw Rachel he knew right away”
